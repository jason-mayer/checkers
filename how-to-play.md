# How to Play Checkers

A checkers game consists of two players (teams), each of which uses a separate color (in this case, red and blue). The blue team goes first, and is located at the bottom of the board. After blue moves, red makes a move, and then the cycle continues until one team wins.

## Moving

In Checkers, pieces may only ever move diagonally, meaning they only ever use the black squares. Regular pieces can only move towards the side of the board that the other team started on. Once a piece reaches the edge (where it can no longer move forward), it is "promoted" to a king, which can move **diagonally** both forward and backwards. The direction(s) that a piece can move are indicated by arrows on the pieces. Both kings and regular pieces can only move **one square at a time**, unless they are capturing.

### Capturing/Jumping

If an **enemy** piece is located in one the squares that your piece can move to, your piece may jump over the enemy piece, as long as the square it will land on exists and is not occupied by **any** piece. Jumping over a piece captures it.

You can chain jumps together. If you jump over a piece and are able to capture another, you must jump over that piece as well. When you capture a piece, your turn does not end until the piece that you used to capture is not able to make any more jumps.

**Important Note:** If it is your turn and you can capture a piece, *you must*. If you are trying to make a move and it is not letting you, that is not a bug, that means you have a capture that you must do.

## Winning

The game ends when one team runs out of pieces **or** when it is a team's turn and that team has no legal moves. The team that has no pieces/moves loses, and the other one wins.
